<h2>The Show</h2>
<br><br>
The Show was a dance performance choreographed by <a href="https://emilydaub.weebly.com/">Emily Daub</a> that explored the relationships between people through interactive wearables that changed color based on proximity to other dancers. The software was developed by me, Annie Kelly, and the garments themselves were designed and fabricated by Emily Daub.
<br><br>
The software can be found <a href="https://github.com/rustynymph/theshow">here</a>.
